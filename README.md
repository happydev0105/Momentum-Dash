# Vision Board Chrome Extension

A personalized vision board Chrome extension inspired by Momentum Dash. This extension provides a clean, modern, and responsive design with dynamic greetings and a customizable vision board to help users stay inspired and focused.

## Features

### Greeting
- Dynamic greeting based on the time of day (e.g., "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", "Good Evening").

### Vision Board
- A dedicated section for a vision board where users can:
  - Add, remove, and rearrange vision items.
  - Add vision items as text or images.
  - Use drag-and-drop functionality to arrange vision items.
  - Display each vision item in a visually appealing manner.

## Design Requirements

### Clean and Modern Design
- The extension should have a minimalist and aesthetically pleasing design.

### Responsive Layout
- The layout should be responsive and work well on desktops and tablets. Mobile responsiveness can be added in future updates.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Preferably use a framework/library like React.js or Vue.js for enhanced functionality.

### Backend (Optional)
- If user data needs to be saved (e.g., vision board items), implement a simple backend using:
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - Database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL

### Authentication (Optional)
- Implement user authentication for personalized dashboards.
